## SEC-ASU-TRAIN-FR1: Train the offering team

Everyone involved in the lifecycle of software development, on-prem products, or cloud offers MUST complete either Cisco Security Flight Academy or Ground School.
- Cisco Security Flight Academy _SHOULD_ be completed by those who design, develop, test or operate.
- Cisco Security Ground School _SHOULD_ be completed by those in less technical roles, like managers of teams, products, and programs.


To determine which course is best suited for your role, refer to [Space Center Guidance](https://cisco.sharepoint.com/sites/SecuritySpaceCenter/SitePages/New-to-Space-Center.aspx#i-am-a-software-developer-or-part-of-a-product-or-offer-team)

## SEC-ASU-TRAIN-FR2: Advanced training for senior roles
Every [offering](#DEF_Offering) architect, every designated security
advocate, every person responsible for supporting PSIRT product security
incident response, and every developer of security-specific
[code](#DEF_Code) _SHOULD_ complete the Cisco Security Space Fleet training (formerly Cisco Security Ninja Green Belt).

## SEC-ASU-TRAIN-FR3: Additional training
Developers _SHOULD_ be formally trained in the specific security
concerns applicable to the application spaces, languages, and tools with
which they are working.

**Supplemental Guidance**
Because of turnover, 100 percent certification isn't always possible. An
[offering](#DEF_Offering) complies with this requirement if at least 90
percent of the affected people are certified, and there is a formal
program in place to certify the rest.
