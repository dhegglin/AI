# Headline 
Reject code with unexpected signatures on installation

(was SEC-SW-INSCHK-FR3)


# Behavior

Signatures not generated by the expected/intended provider(s) of the code _MUST_ be rejected. For example, if you include software in your offering signed by a 3rd party, then the signature can only be verified by a key from that 3rd party provider. If you include code signed by Cisco, then the signature can only be verified by a Cisco key.
