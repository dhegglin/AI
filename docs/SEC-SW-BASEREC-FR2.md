# Headline 
Recovery Performance

# Behavior
The device _MUST_ either implement its own recovery functionality, or as a [symbiont](#DEF_SymbiontDevice) the device together with its host _MUST_ implement the device's recovery capability. In the symbiont relationship the host performs the cryptographic signature verification of the deviceâ€™s recovery image.
